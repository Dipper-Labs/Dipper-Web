      title: 'Mining Mode',
      p: 'Borrowing is mine mining. Users will get the platform TOKEN as a reward as long as they have borrowing behavior on the platform. There are two types of rewards: long-term rewards and irregular rewards. Users with large loan funds and long period of time will receive more rewards.'

      title: 'Community Governance',

      title: 'Cross-chain Dinance',
      p: 'DIPPER NETWORK will only implement asset cross-chaining through the blockchain protocol itself, without the need for third-party involvement. The follow-up will open up COSMOS and POLKADOT and more blockchain networks, so that all kinds of blockchain assets can be efficiently circulated and fully exert their financial value. '

      title: 'Interim',
      p: 'DIP will be used as a deduction for the interest on the loan to promote the consumption and circulation of TOKEN. After the user has reached a certain scale, the platform will set up a governance committee, and users with TOKEN can participate in voting to modify the market interest rate model, activate global clearing, and contract renewal.

Since then, DIP will also play a greater role as a transaction fee, which in turn will result in greater liquidity and value.'
